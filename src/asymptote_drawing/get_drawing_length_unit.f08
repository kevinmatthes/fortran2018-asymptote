!> \param   this        The drawing whose unit shall be copied.
!> \param   length_unit The object to assign the deep copy to.

!> This subroutine will assign a deep copy of this drawing's unit to the output
!> parameter.  If this drawing does not already have a unit, the output
!> parameter will receive an empty string.
!>
!> \note This operation will allocate memory for its output parameter.  This
!> allocation needs to be freed by the caller as the memory allocation is not
!> managed automatically.
